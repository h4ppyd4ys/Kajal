###  Independent Transformation Consulting


Hi, Iâ€™m Kajal  
Welcome to my first blogging space ðŸ˜Š  

Iâ€™ve happily spent most of my professional career traversing the globe for the telecommunications industry. Learning  and experiencing the new continues to be my motivation. I also believe that sharing is caring, so if you are seeking  *truly independent* transformation consulting services that advocate transparency, accountability, quality and traceability head over to my CV, where I have quite honestly described my areas of expertise and please feel free to contact me if I can be of assistance. In the age of fake news I understand if you would like some credible witnesses to verify this experience. These will gladly be provided upon request.  

Having been involuntarily and then voluntarily blitzed with COVID-19 pandemic and even more alarmingly, climate change news/data, I decided I wanted to understand more about the graphs and so called data (to go to source as they say) and so opened the pandoras box of [data science](https://github.com/h4ppyd4ys/h4ppyd4ys.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/docs/DSFoundation.png).  It is with this newly gained skillset that I bring to you this site and my 2nd blog[link to Ofcome data analysis]. Having also completed a [AWS Cloud Fundamentals](https://github.com/h4ppyd4ys/h4ppyd4ys.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/docs/AWSFund.jpg) course via Coursera, I thought about going the extra mile to host this on a AWS server but Github was free so here we are.  

Since we are so much more than the sum of our professional skills i thought i'd use the blogging space to share my experiences with quite possibly the best purchasing decision I ever made, my campervan flo (*who is presently meditating it out, in Tier 4 London lockdown*) along with the realization of a lifelong fascination with the night sky in the form of astrophotography (*presently going through a steep but enjoyable learning curve and patiently waiting for clear skies*).  

Time is precious and one of the greatest gifts we can offer to one another, so much appreciated if you've stayed with me till here. Look forward to exchanging thought vibrations in this space.

May the force be with you.
